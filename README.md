The goal of this Template is to be our starting point for new projects, following the best development practices. It's our interpretation and adaptation of the official [architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) guidelines provided by Google. And it's inspired by Google's [NowInAndroid](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).

## Clean architecture with 3 main modules
- Data (for database, API and preferences code)
- Domain (for business logic and models)
- AndroidApp (for UI logic, with MVVM)

# Getting started

1. Download this repository extract and open the template folder on Android Studio
2. Rename the app package `io.bloco.template`
3. Check if the manifest package was renamed along with the package
4. Replace composables with the Template name
5. On `androidApp/build.gradle`, change the applicationId to the new app package
6. On `androidApp/build.gradle`, update the dependencies Android Studio suggests
7. On `string.xml`, set your application name

**If you run the Project inside the NewProjectCI all the above steps are done by you automatically, you can run the project using Android Studio then Opening the Main.kt file and press "Run MainKt". You will be prompted about a new package name and app name**

8. On `Theme.kt` & `Color.kt` set your application style
9. Replace the App Icons
10. Delete unwanted example files
11. Run `./gradlew dependencyUpdates` and check for dependencies
12. Ready to Use

And you're ready to start working on your new app.

# Notes
- Android Template contains `.github/workflows` for lint check, unit testing and dependency checks. You can easily take this project worflow and repurpose it with a few path changes, you can also find a commented example in test.yml for Instrumentation Testing and CodeCoverage that we advice to keep a clean project, you will however need to replace the secret keys with your own.
